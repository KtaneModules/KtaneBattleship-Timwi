  Title: Battleship
  Description: "\u201CCaptain! Captain!\u201D exclaimed an exhausted voice, as a uniformed
    man hurriedly entered the bridge.\r\n\r\n\u201CAt ease, Commander\u201D, the captain
    said as he turned to face him. He had always felt that, while admirable, the first
    officer seemed to take his responsibilities just a tad too seriously. \u201CWhat\u2019s
    the matter?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe enemy hh\u2014\u201D The officer took a deeper
    breath. \u201CThe enemy has organized a new attack fleet. Here\u2019s our new
    orders we just received.\u201D He handed the captain a sheet of paper. \u201CWe
    are instructed to strike as soon as we can infer the enemy\u2019s positions.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    captain took the paper and scanned it intently. After a while, he commented on
    it. \u201CThis is... our intelligence?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI know, right?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFive
    by five grid... Horizontal or vertical...\u201D He looked pensive. \u201CWe need
    to get a cadet to work out the logic of this. And then we gotta find a suitable
    ensign to operate the torpedo.\u201D He handed the paper back to the officer.
    \u201CFind the right hands for the job and begin training immediately.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAye,
    sir\u201D, the first officer responded with determination. His extended index
    finger swaying side to side, he mumbled, \u201CI think I know just the right ones.\u201D\r\n\n\nModule
